          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and
          a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
          world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in
          the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
          in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that
          exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
          violent instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and
          not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
          Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
            Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
            Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
            ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
            They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that
            Dr. Guth was correct.
          </p>
          <p class="main-content-para">
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
            whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>
          <p>
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of
            dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
            space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
            hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
            architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
            other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                The Theory of Inflation
              </h3>
              <p>
                Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe
                expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.
              </p>
              <div class="theory-of-inflation-image">
                <p class="theory-of-inflation-text1">THE UNIVERSE is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can
                  observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we
                  look, the universe has an even temperature</p>
                <p class="theory-of-inflation-text2">NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one
                  side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and
                  cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>
                <p class="theory-of-inflation-text3">DISTANT COFFEE At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see
                  a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has
                  cooled.</p>
                <p class="theory-of-inflation-text4">COFFEE EVERYWHERE Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee
                  cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every
                  direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>
                <p class="theory-of-inflation-text5">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before
                  they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the
                  same time, that might explain their even temperature</p>
                <p class="theory-of-inflation-text6">INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the
                  Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently
                  expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
                <p class="theory-of-inflation-text7">FLUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of
                  polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe.
                  These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
                <p class="theory-of-inflation-text8">
                  EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and
                  cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of
                  the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

              Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
              confirmation in his lifetime.

            <p class="main-content-para">
              The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
              Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
              meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
              Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.

            <p class="main-content-para">
              Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were
              discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel
              Prize.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of
              Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the
              thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of
              Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has
              been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

              In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the
              light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves,
              squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of
              polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should
              have little arrows going in spirals.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the
              microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

              breakthrough.

              The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his
              Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and
              weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a
              single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk
              mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force
              after another splitting away.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              That was where Dr. Guth came in
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
              until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself
              would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe
              would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created,
              the harder it pushed apart.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a
              submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal
              cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars
              billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth
              likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest
              that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey
              expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a
              concept known as the multiverse.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any deeper
              into the past.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
              everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
              forever out of our view.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of
              the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
