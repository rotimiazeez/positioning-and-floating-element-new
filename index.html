            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
            potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
            have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
            repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
            of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
            heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
            mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
            diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
            and drew a double box around it.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
              that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
              hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
              cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
              astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
              for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
              so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
              wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
              trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
              long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
              and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <p class="main-content-para">
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
              many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
              proved.
            </p>
            <p>
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
              science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
              the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
              realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
              extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
              billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
              cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
              pasta water boiling over.

                    that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's
                    a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even

                    to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and
                    from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature

                    universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
                    ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually
                    grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.

                the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing

                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the
                microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a
                slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than
                another.

                This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
                gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space
                in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by,
                would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves,
                theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky
                should have little arrows going in spirals.

                Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small

              <h3>A Special Time</h3>
              <p class="main-content-para">
                The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
                like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years
                ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
                universe.

              <p class="main-content-para">
                Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
                gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces.
                But they have long suspected that those are simply different
                manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe
                in its earliest, hottest moments.
              </p>
              <p class="main-content-para">
                As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a
                fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or
                brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics
                evolved, with one force after another splitting away.

                Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as
                the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed,

              <p class="main-content-para">
                Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified
                state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued
                with a mysterious latent energy.

              <p class="main-content-para">
                Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act
                as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up.
                Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the
                more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.

                Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into

                was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a
                patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s
                often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr.
                Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free
                lunch.”

              <p class="main-content-para">
                Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models
                resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that
                inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe
                settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the
                cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
                endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.

                We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
                beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before
                it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are
                swept away, forever out of our view.
